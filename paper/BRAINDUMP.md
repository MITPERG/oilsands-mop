Steps:   
1) Find people how have worked on similar problems (or sub-problems) that
are related to mine and see how they went about to solve it. To make sure
I am not forgetting.  
2) If no one has done it, then propose a solution and people will come
to propose different approaches that are going to be fasters.

### Abstract
- what doesn't work? (Why am I reading this? What is the problem with the about the oilsands? what the problem/why?)  
- what have I done/try to go around what doesn't work? (I think that we can take this approach, I proposed this approach)  
- What did I find? (doing this, I obtained this, and this worked/not worked/etc, any steps that help the research)  

There is something that does not work and I propose this to solve it. I will later justify why it is innovation or anything. Doing this I obtined that


Machine Learning & Neural Networks at two levels:  
* Level 1: learning to find satisfactory examples
* Level 2: meta-heuristics (algorithms) which will tell us how to change parameters 

This version:  
* Remove redundancies. Clarify what is what. 
* Clear concept of what I am doing
